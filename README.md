link to portfolio: deftonechris.github.io/portfolio-main/


I made this portfolio page for future projects I will be working on in the bootcamp. The images and text are place holders for when I have more material to showcase. 

-The navbar is linked to the correspoding parts of the page.  

-The images have an opaque effect when the cursor is placed on them.

-Webpage is responisve to smaller view ports.
